# U3.W7: BONUS Using the SQLite Gem

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with:]

require 'sqlite3'


$db = SQLite3::Database.open "congress_poll_results.db"


def print_lowest_grade_level_speakers
  puts "LOWEST GRADE LEVEL SPEAKERS (less than < 8th grade)"
  grade_level = $db.execute("SELECT name, grade_current FROM congress_members WHERE grade_current < 8 ORDER BY grade_current")
  puts grade_level
end
#Create a listing of each Politician and the voter that voted for them
# output should include the senators name, then a long list of voters separated by a comma
print_lowest_grade_level_speakers

# TODO (bonus)
# Create a listing of all of the Politicians and the number of votes they recieved
# output should look like:  Sen. John McCain - 7,323 votes (This is an example, yours will not return this value, it should just 
#    have a similar format)
# Create a listing of each Politician and the voter that voted for them
# output should include the senators name, then a long list of voters separated by a comma
#
# * you'll need to do some join statements to complete these last queries!


# REFLECTION- Include your reflection as a comment below.
# How does the sqlite3 gem work?  What is the variable `$db` holding?  
# Try to use your knowledge of ruby and OO to decipher this as well as h
# ow the `#execute` method works.  Take a stab at explaining the line 
# `$db.execute("SELECT name FROM congress_members WHERE years_in_congress 
#   > #{minimum_years}")`.  Try to explain this as clearly as possible for 
# your fellow students.  
# If you're having trouble, find someone to pair on this explanation with you.
